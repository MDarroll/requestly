I downloaded the extenstion. I have a qr code that leads to a broken website and is alreadty printed on materials. I use the redirect tool and it works 
perfectly on chrome. It doesnt work anywhere else. Do you need that extenstion to redirect ? Can anybody who scans qr code be redirected ? How can i acomplish
this ?
